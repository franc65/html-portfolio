<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Frank, and I’m currently taking a web development course as part of my journey into technology. This is my very first project, 
  and I’m excited to share it with you. I’ve always been passionate about innovation and technology, especially how digital tools can be used to solve 
  real-world problems and improve everyday life.

  Through this course, am learning the foundation of web development, including
  HTML, CSS and Javascript. I enjoy building things from scratch and love to see my ideas come 
  come to life.</p>

<p>This is just the begining, and am lookiing forward to exploring more advance topic in this 
  course as I continue to grow as a developer. Thanks for visiting my site</p>
